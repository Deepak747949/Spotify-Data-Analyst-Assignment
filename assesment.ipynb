    "# 🎵 Spotify Artist Catalog & Unclaimed Musical Works Cross-Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates working with APIs, large datasets, and memory-efficient processing to solve a real-world music data challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieve Spotify Artist Catalog:**  \n",
    "   - Use the Spotify API to fetch a complete catalog of a chosen artist.  \n",
    "   - Include all albums, singles, EPs, and tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Export Catalog with Details:**  \n",
    "   - Track name, album name, release date, and ISRC codes.  \n",
    "   - Handle API rate limits safely to avoid request failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cross-Reference with Large Dataset:**  \n",
    "   - Compare artist ISRCs against the unclaimed works dataset (`unclaimedmusicalworkrightshares.tsv`).  \n",
    "   - Use memory-efficient chunked processing to handle 7GB TSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generate Organized Excel Report:**  \n",
    "   - Sheet 1: Full Artist Catalog.  \n",
    "   - Sheet 2: Matches found in unclaimed dataset.  \n",
    "   - Sheet 3: Notes and process details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **API Integration:** Spotify Web API used for reliable data retrieval.  \n",
    "- **Memory-Efficient Processing:** Large TSV processed in chunks to avoid memory overflow.  \n",
    "- **Data Matching:** ISRC codes cleaned and standardized to ensure accurate cross-referencing.  \n",
    "- **Output:** Clean, structured Excel workbook summarizing artist tracks and unclaimed works matches.\n"
